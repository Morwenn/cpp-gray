**cpp-gray** is an experimental two-part project around [reflected binary
code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code), generally known as **Gray
code**. The project includes the following parts:

* A C++14 library providing a `gray_code` class template, and a set of
related functions to efficiently manipulate Gray codes without always
having to convert them back to the usual two's complement representation.
The documentation of that library can be found in the associated wiki.

* A series of small articles about Gray codes describing the algorithms
used by the library, as well as some additional algorithms and Gray code
properties.
